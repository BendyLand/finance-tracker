# Finance Tracker

## Concept

An easy-to-use finance tracker and planner, written in Python!

The goal of this project is to create a full-stack finance application using several Python libraries.

Intended functionality:
 - Keep track of your balance in as up-to-date of a way as possible.
 - Link bills to your balance and check how long until their due date (or if they're past due).
 - Set bills as "autopay", so they automatically subtract themselves from your balance on their due date. 
 - Check whether you can afford a given purchase amount on the current day.
 - Check whether you can afford a given purchase amount on a given future day (requires pay schedule and bill schedule).

**To be clear:** 

**This tool does not interact with your bank in any way. It is strictly a tool to use for your own financial tracking.**
 - You can name your bills and balance whatever you want. 
 - You can enter any arbitrary numbers for your balance and bills.
 - The only data being used without your input is the current date; everything else comes from you.
 - I know that most people will figure this out on their own, so this is for the small percentage that will somehow think this is a scam.
